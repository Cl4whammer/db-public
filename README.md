Vanilla database for Dawn of Light

## Goal
To provide the DOL community with means to spin up a new server on a solid data foundation.

## Installing
To use this database download and run concat.ps1 or concat.sh. This will combine the sql files into a single script that you can run against an already made database.

## Contributing
Schmea and data scripts have been separated to minimize risk of schema being accidently modified. Data modifications should follow the fomatting convention used throughout.

## The data
We plan on following data available on http://camelot.allakhazam.com/ as closely as possible. We think this will be the most effective way quickly populate missing data.
